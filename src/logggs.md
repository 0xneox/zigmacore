LLM Response: {
  "delta": -0.01,
  "confidence": 80,
  "narrative": "While Paradex has a strong potential for launching a token by the deadline, the absence of recent news or developments creates uncertainty. The current market price is high, suggesting consensus on a YES outcome, which typically warrants a confidence reduction. However, the medium settlement risk indicates that there is still a reasonable chance of success, justifying a slight negative delta adjustment."
