Full Launch Plan: Zigma Oracle to 10/10
Core Thesis: Agent is 10/10 (functional, unique edge oracle). Launch focuses on organic cult build—polymarket niche, but viral potential via accurate signals. No hype, data-driven. Token secondary (launch post-adoption). Brutal: Fail if signals aren't rare/accurate; succeed if cult forms.

Branding Brainstorm (Design Zigma Identity)
Name/URL: zigma.pro (clean, oracle-like). X: @agentzigma (option: @zigmadotfun—more fun, less serious; stick with @agentzigma for credibility).
Logo/Visuals: Terminal/console theme (green/black, matrix vibes). Tagline: "Oracle, Not Opinion." Slogan: "Defaults to NO_TRADE. Speaks Only When Edge Survives."
Tone: Mysterious, data-obsessed, no memes. Avoid crypto-bro hype. Emojis sparse (e.g., 🔮 for signals).
Colors: Black bg, green text (#00ff00), yellow accents (#ffff00), red warnings (#ff0000).
Assets: Logo PNG, banner (oracle circuit board), profile pic (Zigma eye).
Branding Rules: All posts end with "VERIFY EVERYTHING. zigma.pro". Disclaimers: Educational only, DYOR.
Brainstorm Ideas: Viral hook—"Oracle that stays silent 99% time." Differentiator: AI + deterministic (vs. bots). Cult angle: "Join the few who see edges."
Step 1: Pre-Launch Setup (Day 0-1)
X Account: Create @agentzigma. Bio: "Polymarket Oracle | AI-Enhanced Edge Detection | Defaults to NO_TRADE | zigma.pro". Pinned tweet: "Launching soon. Follow for rare signals."
Website Prod: Deploy zigma.pro (Vite to Netlify/Vercel). Ensure HTTPS, fast load. Add GA for analytics. Test UI live.
Branding Assets: Design logo/banner in Canva/Figma. Update UI if needed (e.g., add links).
Backend Prod: Set SAFE_MODE=false for live posts. Test cron cycles. Monitor logs.
TG Setup: Create channel (@zigmaoracle) for announcements/signals. Group (@zigmagroup) for discussion. Bio: "Official Zigma Oracle community. Signals rare by design."
Domain Check: Confirm zigma.pro owned; option zigmadotfun.com if needed.
Step 2: Launch Day (Day 1)
Announce Website: X thread: "Zigma Oracle launches. Website live: zigma.pro. Oracle for polymarket edges. Defaults to NO_TRADE. Follow for signals."
Post 1-2 Manual: Introduce agent, philosophy. "What is Zigma? [Explain]."
TG Launch: Post in channel/group: "Welcome. Signals posted here. Join discussion."
Step 3: Content Strategy (10 Posts/Day Automated + Manual Review)
Automation: Cron posts signals via backend (SAFE_MODE off). Format: "📊 SIGNAL: [Market] → [Action] (Confidence: X%). Reasoning: [Brief]. zigma.pro #Polymarket"
10 Posts/Day: 7-8 signals (if generated), 2-3 educational ("Why NO_TRADE?"), 1 engagement ("What market interests you?").
Manual Review: Check all posts before auto-send. Edit for clarity. Add context (e.g., "News drove delta").
Content Types:
Signals: Rare (agent design), so supplement with retrospectives.
Educational: "How edges survive uncertainty."
Polls: "Will [market] resolve YES? Vote."
Threads: Weekly market analysis.
Scheduling: Posts at 9AM, 12PM, 3PM, 6PM, 9PM UTC (global reach). TG mirrors X.
Brainstorm Hooks: "Oracle silent again. Edge not found." Builds anticipation. Share logs screenshots.
Step 4: Growth to 1000 X Followers in 7 Days
Target: 1000 organic (polymarket niche: 10k total users, aim 10%).
Strategies:
Viral Signals: Accurate calls drive shares (e.g., "Zigma called [win], check history").
Engagement: Reply to polymarket tweets. "Zigma sees edge here: [analysis]."
Cross-Promo: TG invites in bio/X. "Join TG for real-time signals."
Influencers: DM polymarket influencers (e.g., @polymarket, traders). "Check zigma.pro for edges."
Hashtags: #Polymarket #PredictionMarkets #CryptoOracle.
Giveaways: "RT for chance to feature your market analysis."
Metrics: Track daily followers, engagement (likes/RTs). Goal: 150/day avg.
TG Growth: Channel to 500 subs, group to 200. Post signals, discussions.
Brutal Risk: If signals inaccurate, ghost town. Mitigate: Start with low-volume tests.
Step 5: Token Prep & Launch (Within 7 Days, Post 1000 Followers)
Token Name/Symbol: Zigma (ZIG) or Zigma Oracle (ZOR). Description: "Utility token for polymarket oracle access. Burn for premium feeds/audits. No yield. Usage-aligned."
Logo/Symbol: Oracle eye/terminal icon.
Supply: 1B total, 20% launch, rest vesting.
CyreneAI Launchpad: Submit project. Requirements: Whitepaper (oracle mechanics), team (anon?), tokenomics. Timeline: 2-3 days approval.
Pre-Launch Hype: X/TG: "Token launching soon on CyreneAI. Utility: Premium access."
Launch Event: Fair launch on CyreneAI. Post DEX migration.
Step 6: Post-Launch (DEX Paid, Migrated)
DEX Migration: To Uniswap/Arbitrum (polymarket chain?). Marketing: "DEX live. Buy ZIG for premium."
Token Utility: Burn for API access, historical data, messaging. Integrate in UI/backend.
Continued Ops: 10 posts/day, grow followers to 10k. Monitor adoption.
Risks & Mitigations
Low Adoption: If signals boring (all NO_TRADE), pivot to more buys. Mitigate: Educate on rarity.
Competition: Other oracles emerge. Mitigate: Differentiate (AI + deterministic).
Tech Issues: Posts fail. Mitigate: Manual fallback.
Legal: Gambling regs. Mitigate: Disclaimers, educational focus.
Metrics & Timeline
Day 1: Launch, 100 followers.
Day 3: 400 followers, 5 TG subs.
Day 7: 1000 X, 300 TG. Token launch.
Week 2: DEX live, 5000 X followers.
Success KPI: 10k X in month, active TG, token volume.
Plan executed. Agent 10/10, launch ready. Go.
