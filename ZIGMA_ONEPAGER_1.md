# ZIGMA ONE-PAGER

**The Silent Oracle** | AI-Powered Prediction Market Intelligence

---

## The Problem

Prediction market traders face a structural disadvantage. Professional traders use sophisticated AI systems and real-time data processing. Retail traders rely on manual analysis across 1,000+ markets spanning multiple platforms—an unsustainable information gap that systematically favors institutional participants.
