# ZIGMA PITCH DECK

**The Silent Oracle**

*AI-Powered Prediction Market Intelligence*

January 2026

## Slide 1: Title

# ZIGMA

**The Silent Oracle**

*Detects structural edge. Remains silent otherwise.*

Fair Launch: January 28, 2026 | CyreneAI

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

### Prediction Markets Have a Structural Problem

**Information Asymmetry**

Professional traders and market makers have access to proprietary analysis tools, real-time data processing, and sophisticated risk models. Retail traders rely on intuition and manual research.

**The Numbers**

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Markets to monitor | 1,000+ active markets across platforms |
| Analysis time required | 4-8 hours daily for comprehensive coverage |
| Retail trader disadvantage | Estimated 15-20% edge gap vs. professionals |

**Result**: Most retail participants trade at a systematic disadvantage.

**Gap**: No accessible, AI-powered oracle exists for prediction market traders.

---

## Slide 3: The Solution

### ZIGMA: Institutional-Grade Intelligence for Everyone

**What We Do**

ZIGMA continuously monitors 1,000+ prediction markets, analyzes structural inefficiencies using AI, and generates trading signals with institutional-grade risk management.

**Core Capabilities**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| AI Analysis | LLM-powered probability assessment |
| Multi-Platform | Polymarket, Kalshi, Jupiter, Raydium, Option Markets |
| Risk Management | Kelly Criterion sizing, liquidity vetting |
| Transparency | Full audit trails and signal rationale |

**The Silent Oracle Principle**

We speak only when structural edge exists. Silence is our default state.

## Slide 4: How It Works

### Signal Generation Pipeline

```
Data Collection → AI Analysis → Risk Filters → Signal Distribution
    (22 sec)        (LLM)        (6 layers)      (Real-time)
```

**Signal Requirements**

| Parameter | Minimum Threshold |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Effective Edge | ≥5% |
| Confidence | ≥68% |
| Liquidity | ≥$10,000 |
| Position Size | ≤5% of bankroll |

**Signal Classification**

| Class | Edge | Confidence | Liquidity |
|-------|------|------------|-----------|
| STRONG | >10% | >80% | >$50K |
| MEDIUM | 5-10% | 68-80% | >$20K |
| PROBE | 3-5% | 60-68% | >$10K |

| Active Traders | 100K | 300K | 500K+ |
| Platform Count | 5 | 8 | 12+ |

**Market Sizing**

| Segment | Size | ZIGMA Relevance |
